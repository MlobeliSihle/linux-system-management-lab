# Linux System Management Lab

### Overview
A structured, hands on Linux project designed to simulate real world system administration and cybersecurity tasks. Across seven days, I built, secured, monitured, automated,and audited a complete Linux environment following the same responsibilities expected from an entry level Soc Analyst, SysAdmin, or junior cybersecurity engineer.

### Project Objective
To design and manage a secure Linux system from scratch while demonstracting practical skills in:
- User and group administration
- Permissions and ownership
- File system structure and organization
- Backup creation and automation
- Logging and auditing
- File integrity monitoring
- Bash scripting for automation
The goal was to create a fully functional, secured, and monitored Linux lab similar to what is used in enterprise environments. 

### Tasks Covered
- File and directory management
- Permissions and ownership
- User management
- Backup and automation with bash
- logging and auditing

### Progress Structure

- Designed and created a full linux system management lab
- Built structured directories for reports, backups, logging, and user data
- Added multiple users and assigned groups following security best practices
- Applied correct permissions and ownership across all directories
- Developed a functional system wide backup solution
- Wrote using BASH script
- Validated permissions and log entries to ensure security and integrity
- Documented all processes, commands, and results
