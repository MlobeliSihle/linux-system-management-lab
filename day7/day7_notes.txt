Day 7: File Integrity Monitoring

Files in this directory:
- integrity_test.txt
- file_hash_initial.txt		~ Original SHA256 fingerprint
- file_hash_modified.txt	~ New fingerprint after modification
- hash_comparison.txt		~ Shows difference between hashes

Reflection:
Practiced how hashing can detect file tampering. By coparing the original and modified hashes, i confirmed that a file has been changed.
